# JavaScript_Racer
JavaScript Racer game is written in 3 different architectural patterns. [Spaghetti Code, OOJS, MVC JS]

I wrote this 3 different ways to prove to myself I understand how each pattern works and to be able to compare each style side by side for new comers learning JS. I kept the styling to a bear minimum so you can focus on what really matters, the code structure.

Spaghetti Code:
Player Controls[Player 1: a, Player2: l]

bits and pieces of reflexion:
Super fast and easy to get up and running.
Place variable declarations up top




OOJS:
Player Controls[Player 1: a, Player2: l]

bits and pieces of reflexion:

MVC JS:
Player Controls, User[s] select.

bits and pieces of reflexion:


I hope you have much much more fun playing this game than I did writing it.
